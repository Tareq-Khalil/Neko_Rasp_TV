# Neko Rasp TV 

A Raspberry Pi-powered Cat TV that plays high-quality bird and squirrel videos with sound, inside a sleek, cat-proof enclosure. Touch input is disabled, so it can run hands-free for hours, designed especially for curious feline minds.

## Why I Made This Project

My cat loves sitting in front of a window and watching birds. I wanted to build a dedicated Cat TV that works out-of-the-box, boots straight into a stream, and plays videos continuously without distractions. I also wanted it to look clean and polished on a shelf-like a real product, not a pile of wires.
